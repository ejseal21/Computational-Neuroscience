function plotCategoryBoxes(A, data_y, n, C, w_code, w_out, train_or_test, y_pred)
  %plotCategoryBoxes plots the data and the category boxes to visualize fuzzy ARTMAP.
  %
  % Goal: Plot the data and network state on a SINGLE figure/plot. In other words, this function should only generate
  % ONE pop-up window, even if this function is called multiple times.
  % If called a second time, the previous plot should be wiped clean and your function should draw everything fresh
  % to reflect the current data sample and network state. The intended use case is to call it in every iteration of the
  % main training/testing loop to visualize what's happening.
  % NOTE: Only intended for use on the CIS dataset!
  %
  % Parameters
  %%%%%%%%%%%%
  % A: matrix. size=(2*M, N). All the data samples / inputs (all N of them)
  % m: matrix. size=(1, N). Class of each data sample
  % n: int. Index of current input
  % M: Number of features (before complement coding)
  % C: Number of committed nodes
  % w_code: matrix. size=(2*M, C_max). Input-to-coding-layer adaptive weights. Only 1 thru C are committed.
  % w_out: matrix. size=(C_max, n_classes). Coding-layer-to-output-class-layer adaptive weights. 
  %   This tells us which output class each committed coding cell is associated with (which class it tends to predict).
  % train_or_test. string. 'train' if plotting during training, 'test' if plotting during prediction.
  % y_pred: matrix. size=(n_classes, # test samples). NOTE: Only provided when processing test set/making predictions.
  %   Each column vector contains the prediction for the corresponding test sample.
  %   In fast learning this is a matrix of one-hot coded vectors: every vector contains a 1 in the predicted
  %   class, 0s elsewhere.
  %
  % TODO
  %%%%%%%%%%%%
  % 1) Create a new figure with an equal/square aspect ratio (x scale == y scale). You'll know if this isn't working
  % if your circle looks like an ellipse!
  % 2) Draw a circle centered at (x, y) = (0.5, 0.5) with radius 1/sqrt(2*pi). This matches the "ground truth" boundary
  % between circle and square class points. Set your x/y limits appropriately, knowing that the CIS data always falls in
  % the unit square. You shouldn't make it hard to see samples that fall on the extreme borders.
  % 3) Draw the category boxes for all COMMITTED coding units color-coded by class (circle->blue, square->red).
  % For each coding unit, trace out a rectangle by connecting the following path:
  %   x: [w(1), 1-w(3), 1-w(3), w(1), w(1)]
  %   y: [w(2), w(2), 1-w(4),1-w(4), w(2)]
  % where w is shorthand for the w_code and the indices are COLUMN indices.
  % NOTE: You cannot simply copy-paste the above.
  %
  % If training:
  % 4) Draw the current data sample being processed in black with a + shaped marker. Show the actual sample, not the
  % complement coded version.
  % 5) Draw all the previous data samples color coded by their class (circle->blue, square->red). To help visual
  % discriminability, make the circle sample markers a circle shape, and the square sample markers square shaped.
  %
  % If testing/making prediction:
  % 4) Draw all predicted up to and including the current data sample, color-coded by the PREDICTED class.
  % 5) If the predicted class is correct for a data sample, make the plot marker a circle. if the predicted class is
  % incorrect, make the marker an x.
  %
  % Tip: It is possible to write this function without any loops
